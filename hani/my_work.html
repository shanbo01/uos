			<td><p>This image to me is one of the best peices of art that i have worked on using photoshop. The texture and tone of the wood set down a very subdue tone and the way the smoke floats above the pipe completes the whole gloomy effect.</p></td>
			<td><p>In this image, i was exploring the different effects that could be applied to an image. Anything from increasing the saturation, decreasing or increasing the opacity and couple other options. It was very interesting to see the infinite amount of options that could be done to alter a picture.</p></td>

			<td><p>This is a simple but very true poster that i created using microsoft publisher. It shows the simple actions that humans could take to hugely cut down on the pollution of our enviroment.</p></td>
			<td><p>In this image, you could see a part of the c++ code that i wrote. Whta this small program does is that it points out lower cased letters at the begiing of every new word and replaces it with an upper case letter.</p></td>
