		<h1>About myself</h1>
		<p>My name is Hani Shanableh, I am 18 years old, and I come from Palestine. I was born and raised in the U.A.E and I still currently live here. My family is a group of 4 people, myself, my father, my mother and my younger brother. I am the oldest child between me and my brother. My father has been a professor at the University of Sharjah for the past 19 years, and because of that I have been living in the university’s compound complex my entire life.</p>

		<h1>What I'm doing</h1>
		<p>I am currently acquiring my bachelor’s degree in computer science I.t multimedia.  I hope to finish my degree in the next 3 years and then hopefully moveout to the United States of America to continue my master’s degree in web design and UIX. I would also like to work there too for a few years to increase my cultural and general knowledge about life and gain a firm amount of experience working in hopefully a good company.</p>
