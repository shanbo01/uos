		<p>Since I was 14 years old, I started listening to a lot of billionare's podcasts and got myself a notebook to write down all the important information that I was learning. Doing that lead me to always be regulary updated about the most successful buisness around the world (which are called the sp500) and, I have even made a few very successful callouts when it came to a company's stock rising emersively.  </p>

		<p>I am very passionate about how a business works and always had dreams of becoming a very successful businessman, and I believe that the user-interface part of any business is one of the most crucial blocks in its success. The skills that I am trying to acquire at university are all to help me understand and become an expert in enhancing the userâ€™s interface experience, to be able to put myself in a position where I understand my customers and build around their needs.</p>
