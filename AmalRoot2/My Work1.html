      <h2>My Work</h2>
      <p>I visit restaurants and caf√©s and take video of the environment, staffs, the food, drinks, basically everything and review them on my social media like Tiktok and Instagram. Who doesnt love taking pictures and videos these day. Wherever you go you'll find teenagers and adults taking pictures of themselves or the place or even a coffee!. I love taking pictures and videos whenever I travel or visit new places, restaurants, or cafes, and posting them on social media. Taking pictures makes you adapt more knowledge and be more creative, it makes you want to think of new idea and new ways of taking pictures and videos. My work makes me happy!</p>

 <p>You've got to love what you do to really make things happen the way you want it to. Working can be stressful and tiring sometimes, but its worth all of our time and hardwork when you're working on something you love.</p>
